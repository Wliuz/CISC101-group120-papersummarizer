Purpose: Apply logical checks for realism and readability. Steps:

If/Else Logic:

If section < 20 words → exclude.

If section contains expert terms → translate into layperson language.

If section has no words → ignore.

If section has important information → add citation marker (e.g., “(see Section 2)”).

If total summary > 300 words → shorten or simplify (remove redundancy, compress sentences).

Final Output:

Concise, plain-language summary with citations, capped at 300 words.
